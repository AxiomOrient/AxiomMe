# Documentation Index

Canonical documentation is intentionally minimal and conflict-free.

## Active Files

- `FEATURE_SPEC.md`
- `API_CONTRACT.md`
- `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`

## Rule

- The canonical URI scheme is `axiom://`.
- Naming, protocol, examples, and acceptance text must follow the same source of truth.
